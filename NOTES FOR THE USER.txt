To view the actual working website
1) Copy files in 'wamp64/www/final' folder 
2) Change .env database to match the one in the actual database
3) Create a new database in phpmyAdmin with the same name as the one in .env
4) From CMD add the command >php artisan migrate
5) From CMD add the command >php artisan db:seed --class=MoviesTableSeeder

To get data from the database
'fetchDataFromDB.php' file is a short sample piece of code that will fetch data from the database.

To use the custom command that deletes the Movie with title "test2":
- From CMD add the command >php artisan custom:command (This should be similar to the cron job that is supposed to automatically update the database)
